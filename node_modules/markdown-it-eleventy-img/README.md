# markdown-it-eleventy-img
A [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) plugin that processes images through the [eleventy-img](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-img) plugin. Can be used in any projects that use markdown-it. Fully compatible with the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.

## Status

This is pre-release software. There might still be API changes. I'm pretty much developing this plugin in the open and I'm learning buckets! 

**Use at your own risk**, but feel free to get in touch if you have questions, a comment or want to talk about your experience as a user.

## Requirements

Same as [eleventy-img](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-img). Was tested with markdown-it `v9.0.0` and Eleventy `v1.0.1`.

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev markdown-it-eleventy-img
```

## Usage

This plugin is zero-config by default and can be use as a regular [markdown-it plugin](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it#plugins-load).

```js
const md = require('markdown-it')()
  .use(require("markdown-it-eleventy-img"));
```
With [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (11ty), use the [config API](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/) `setLibrary` method.
```js
// .eleventy.js (or your config file.)

const markdownIt = require('markdown-it');
const markdownItEleventyImg = require("markdown-it-eleventy-img");

module.exports = function(config) {
  config.setLibrary('md', markdownIt ({
    html: true,
    breaks: true,
    linkify: true
  })
  .use(markdownItEleventyImg);
}
```
Using markdown-it-eleventy-img without options will run eleventy-img with [default options](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/#usage) which are:

* `widths: [null]`
* `formats: ["webp", "jpeg"]`
* `urlPath: "/img/"`
* `outputDir: "./img/"`

So using:

```md
<!-- index.md -->

![Image alt](./img/my-image.jpg "Title text!")
```

Will output:

```html
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/wtdfPs-yjZ-2048.webp 2048w"><img alt="Image alt" title="Title text!" src="/img/wtdfPs-yjZ-2048.jpeg" width="2048" height="1463"></picture></p>
```
By default, images are rendered using the `generateHTML` function from the eleventy-img plugin with the `whitespaceMode` "to strip the whitespace from the output of the `<picture>` element (a must-have for use in markdown files)" ([reference](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/#use-this-in-your-templates)).

You can add an options object to override eleventy-img defaults, add global attributes or provide your own custom rendering.

## Using options

The options object may contain these properties: 
* `imgOptions` (object).
Overrides eleventy-img specific options.
* `globalAttributes` (object).
Adds attributes to the image output.
* `renderImage` (function).
Lets you render custom markup and do almost everything you like with your markdown images (see [Custom image rendering](#custom-image-rendering)).
* `resolvePath` (function).
Lets you decide how you want to resolve paths for images. By default, `markdown-it-eleventy-img` will resolve path against project root (see [Resolving path](#resolving-path)).

Here's an exemple of using the options object:

```js
.use(markdownItEleventyImg, {
  imgOptions: {
    widths: [800, 500, 300],
    urlPath: "/images/",
    outputDir: path.join("_site", "images"),
    formats: ["avif", "webp", "jpeg"]
  },
  globalAttributes: {
    class: "markdown-image",
    decoding: "async",
    // If you use multiple widths,
    // don't forget to add a `sizes` attribute.
    sizes: "100vw"
  }
});
```
With these options, the image `![Image alt](./img/my-image.jpg "Title text!")`, will be rendered as:

```html
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/images/wtdfPs-yjZ-300.avif 300w, /images/wtdfPs-yjZ-500.avif 500w, /images/wtdfPs-yjZ-800.avif 800w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/wtdfPs-yjZ-300.webp 300w, /images/wtdfPs-yjZ-500.webp 500w, /images/wtdfPs-yjZ-800.webp 800w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/images/wtdfPs-yjZ-300.jpeg 300w, /images/wtdfPs-yjZ-500.jpeg 500w, /images/wtdfPs-yjZ-800.jpeg 800w" sizes="100vw"><img alt="Image alt" title="Title text!" class="markdown-image" decoding="async" src="/images/wtdfPs-yjZ-300.jpeg" width="800" height="571"></picture></p>
```
The `alt`, the `src`, and the `title` attributes are taken from the markdown token: `![alt](./source.ext "Title")`. 

Setting `alt` or `src` properties in `globalAttributes` will have no effect on the markdown image output. These attributes have to be set on the markdown image token instead.

A warning will be logged in the console if these properties are set in `globalAttributes`.

The `title` property can be set in `globalAttributes`, but there's probably little insentive to do so. Attributes set on the token will always override global attributes.

## Custom image rendering

You may use the `renderImage` method to customize the output or to add logic to your image rendering. This function is returned inside of the image renderer so any string returned by `renderImage` will render the markup for every image tokens.

```js
renderImage(image, attributes) {
  const [ src, attrs ] = attributes;
  const alt = attrs.alt;
    
  return `<img src="${src}" alt="${alt}">`;
}
```

`renderImage` takes two parameters and each one are tuples.

```js
renderImage(image, attributes) {
  const [ Image, options ] = image;
  const [ src, attrs ] = attributes;

  // ...
}
```
We separate the `src` form the rest of the attributes to facilitate the use of the `Image` class. If you need to, it is simple to reunite.

```js
const [ src, attrs ] = attributes;
const allAttributes = { ...attrs, src }
```

Here's an exemple of adding a `<figure>` parent and an optional `<figcaption>`.

```js
.use(markdownItEleventyImg, {
  imgOptions: {
    widths: [600, 300],
    urlPath: "/images/",
    outputDir: "./_site/images/",
    formats: ["avif", "webp", "jpeg"]
  },
  globalAttributes: {
    class: "markdown-image",
    decoding: "async",
    sizes: "100vw"
  },
  renderImage(image, attributes) {
    const [ Image, options ] = image;
    const [ src, attrs ] = attributes;

    Image(src, options);

    const metadata = Image.statsSync(src, options);
    const imageMarkup = Image.generateHTML(metadata, attrs, {
      whitespaceMode: "inline"
    });

    return `<figure>${imageMarkup}${attrs.title ? `<figcaption>${attrs.title}</figcaption>` : ""}</figure>`;
  }
});
```
> Note that you have to use eleventy-img [synchronous API](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/#synchronous-shortcode) inside `renderImage`. Unfortunately, markdown-it plugins doesn't support async code (see [Limitations](#limitations)). It's good to know that even in the sync API, the images are generated asychronously. Got to üòç 11ty!

## Resolving path
By default, `markdown-it-eleventy-img` will resolve relative paths against current working directory (project root). Use `resolvePath` to configure how paths are resolved. Returned value: the source path.

The `resolvePath` method takes two arguments:
1. The image source from the token.
2. The `env` parameter from the Markdown-it renderer.

Here's an example of resolving path relative to the markdown file in Eleventy:
```js
config.setLibrary("md", md.use(markdownItEleventyImg, {
  resolvePath: (filepath, env) => path.join(path.dirname(env.page.inputPath), filepath)
}));
```
Since Eleventy is [passing its supplied data to `env`](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/1510#issuecomment-1046128400), this is possible. It may or may not be possible in other context. It was only tested with Eleventy.

## Use with markdown-it-attrs

Starting with `v0.3.0`, markdown-it-eleventy-img is fully compatible with [markdown-it-attrs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-attrs). Setting attributes with markdown-it-attrs will be passed to the image output. Same attributes will be overridden. The attribute set on the token will prevail over `globalAttributes`.

## Limitations

markdown-it-eleventy-img is currently **not supported with remote sources**. Starting with `v0.7.0`, the default behavior will be to revert to native markdown-it renderer whenever remote images are encountered (local sources will still be rendered through eleventy-img).

To process remote images, use code where the eleventy-img [async API](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/#asynchronous-shortcode) is allowed. For a more technical expaination see [issue#2](https://github.com/solution-loisir/markdown-it-eleventy-img/issues/2).

## Alignements

markdown-it-eleventy-img tries to follow as much as possible the [markdown philosophy](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy). The idea is to keep simplicity while generating responsive image format in markdown. With markdown-it-eleventy-img, you author images in markdown the same way as usual.

Also, the aim is to stay coherent with [eleventy-img](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) defaults while allowing users to use the full feature set. So if your familiar with the eleventy-img plugin, there should be no surprises. 

markdown-it-eleventy-img is not a replacement for an Eleventy [shortcode](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/shortcodes/). Shortcodes will give more power and control. On the other hand, markdown will trade control for easiness of reading and writing. 

[Admittedly, it‚Äôs fairly difficult to devise a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù syntax for placing images into a plain text document format.](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#img) That beiing said, it's probably nicer to use markdown image syntax to include an image in a blog post than to use a shortcode. So markdown-it-eleventy-img is mainly an ergonomic solution for using eleventy-img plugin with the markdown image synthax.

## Motivation

I've seen it asked [here](https://github.com/AleksandrHovhannisyan/aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/issues/118#issuecomment-1190703611) and [there](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-img/issues/90): can I use the eleventy-img plugin with markdown token? I thought it was a good challenge and I ended-up publishing my work.
